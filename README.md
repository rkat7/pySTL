# pySTLtools

pySTLtools is a Python package with mathematical tools that could come handy.
Aimed at becoming an equivalent to STL in C++.

## Installation

Run the following to install:
```python
pip install pySTLtools
```

## Usage

Currently has 3 functions. 
One for returning primes until a given limit using Sieve of Atkin.
Another for counting number of setbits in binary representation of an integer.
And the other is for checking if a bit is set in the binary representation of an integer. 

```python

pySTLtools.primes_till_(15)
```
Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

```python
pySTLtools.is_bit_set(7,1)
```
Output: True

```python
pySTLtools.count_set_bits(9)
```
Output: 2


# Developing pySTLtools

Contributions/Collaborations to/on this project are very welcomed! Any small help is appreciated :)
I belive the tools that could be developed on this project could be endless
