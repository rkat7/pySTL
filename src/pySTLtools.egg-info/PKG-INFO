Description: # pySTLtools
        
        pySTLtools is a Python package with mathematical tools that could come handy.
        Aimed at becoming an equivalent to STL in C++.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run the following to install:
        ```python
        pip install pySTLtools
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Currently has 3 functions. 
        One for returning primes until a given limit using Sieve of Atkin.
        Another for counting number of setbits in binary representation of an integer.
        And the other is for checking if a bit is set in the binary representation of an integer. 
        
        ```python
        
        pySTLtools.primes_till_(15)
        ```
        Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
        
        ```python
        pySTLtools.is_bit_set(7,1)
        ```
        Output: True
        
        ```python
        pySTLtools.count_set_bits(9)
        ```
        Output: 2

        Contributions/Collaborations to/on this project are very welcomed! Any small help is appreciated :)
        I belive the tools that could be developed on this project could be endless
